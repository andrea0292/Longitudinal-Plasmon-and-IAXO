# Longitudinal-Plasmon-and-IAXO
I compute here the LP-axion conversion, with detection prospects for IAXO. In particular I give here the solar model we used in

and compute with it the axion flux from both longitudinal plasmon (https://inspirehep.net/literature/1793840) and Primakoff. I also give some basic equations and functions to deal with IAXO detection. For more details see https://inspirehep.net/literature/1801896.
